### Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

- The ``` plain.cpp ``` contains the direct implementation of the SSS scheme based on the research paper written bby Adi Shamir. THe link for the research paper : [How to Share a secret](https://web.mit.edu/6.857/OldStuff/Fall03/ref/Shamir-HowToShareASecret.pdf)
- The ```SSS_IN_FIELD.cpp``` contains the implementation that works for real time huge numbers. This is being done with the help of Modulo-mathematics (For dealing with huge numbers).
- Explanation of different functions implemented: 
    1. ``` vector<int>generateRandomPoly(int k) ``` : Generates an array of random numbers that represent the coefficients of a polynomial of degree "K-1". Here K is the number of shares being generated by the central node. 
    2. ``` vector<int> generateShares (vector<int>poly) ``` : Generates the share values from the polynomial. The share value of a particular node is simply the polynomial function value when substituted with the index of that node.
    3. ``` vector<int> generateFieldShares (vector<int>shares) ``` : This function generates the corresponding shares values in a field generated by the decided field prime.
    4. ``` int generateLagrangeConstant(int shareVal, int shareSize, int shareNo) ``` : Generates a lagrange constant value for each share ( by subsituting the resulting lagranges interpolating polynomial with 0 ).
    5. ``` int verify(vector<int>fieldShares) ``` : This simply sums up the langranges constants returned for each share keeping the field in mind. The resulting sum should be the secret of the Central Node. We can verify it by comparing it to the constant term in the polynomial.
